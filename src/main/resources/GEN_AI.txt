As an AI language model, I am not able to provide a specific tutorial on how to create an image dynamically with content in Gen AI DALL-E. However, I can explain the general process of how it works.

Gen AI DALL-E is an artificial intelligence program developed by OpenAI that generates images from textual input. To create an image dynamically, you need to provide a textual description or prompt to Gen AI DALL-E, which will then generate an image based on the input.

The process typically involves the following steps:
Define the content or idea you want to convey in the image.
Write a textual prompt or description that captures the content or idea.
Submit the prompt or description to Gen AI DALL-E.
Wait for Gen AI DALL-E to generate the image.
Review and adjust the generated image as needed.

The specific steps and tools used to create an image dynamically with content in Gen AI DALL-E may vary depending on the platform or software you are using. It's important to refer to the documentation or tutorials provided by the platform or software to ensure you are using the correct approach.

FAQ:
TOKEN: You can think of tokens as pieces of words used for natural language processing.
For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words

Which model to use:
gpt-4 generally performs better on a wide range of evaluations, while gpt-3.5-turbo returns outputs with lower latency and costs much less per token

How will I know how many tokens Iâ€™ve used each month?
usage tracking dashboard.

How can I manage my speding
You can set a monthly budget in your billing settings, after which weâ€™ll stop serving your requests. 

 ChatGPT API and ChatGPT Plus subscription are billed separately.
 Yes, we treat Playground usage the same as regular API usage.
 
 
How is pricing calculated for Completions?
 Chat completion requests are billed based on the number of input tokens sent plus the number of tokens in the output(s) returned by the API.

Your request may use up to num_tokens(input) + [max_tokens * max(n, best_of)] tokens, which will be billed at the per-engine rates outlined at the top of this page.

In the simplest case, if your prompt contains 200 tokens and you request a single 900 token completion from the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 API, your request will use 1100 tokens and will cost [(200 * 0.001) + (900 * 0.002)] / 1000 = $0.002.

SLA:We will be publishing an SLA soon. In the meantime you can visit our Status page to monitor service availability and view historical uptime.

AZURE GEN AI :

Properties:
Model name: gpt-35-turbo
Model version: 0301
Version update policy: Once the current version expires.
Deployment type: Standard
Content Filter: Default
Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands): 120
Rate limit (Tokens per minute): 120000
Rate limit (Requests per minute): 720

	


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why prompt:
These models canâ€™t read your mind. If outputs are too long, ask for brief replies. If outputs are too simple, ask for expert-level writing. If you dislike the format, demonstrate the format youâ€™d like to see. The less the model has to guess at what you want

- Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks
- Give the model time to "think"
	- Asking for a "chain of thought" before an answer can help the model reason its way toward correct answers more reliably.
- Strategy: Write clear instructions

		- BAD: Whoâ€™s president?
		- GOOD:Who was the president of Mexico in 2021, and how frequently are elections held?
		-BAD: Summarize the meeting notes.
		GOOD:Summarize the meeting notes in a single paragraph. Then write a markdown list of the speakers and each of their key points. Finally, list the next steps or action items suggested by the speakers, if any.
		
- Ask the model to adopt a persona
	- System messgae is need for persona
	- EG:System: When I ask for help to write something, you will reply with a document that contains at least one joke or playful comment in every paragraph.
 - Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
   - EG: Delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, section titles, etc. can help demarcate sections of text to be treated differently.
   
 - SYSTEM: You will be provided with a pair of articles (delimited with XML tags) about the same topic. First summarize the arguments of each article. Then indicate which of them makes a better argument and explain why
 -USER: 
<article> insert first article here </article>

<article> insert second article here </article>

- Tactic: Specify the steps required to complete a task
		- SYSTEM >> Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs.
					Step 1 - The user will provide you with text in triple quotes. Summarize this text in one sentence with a prefix that says "Summary: ".

					Step 2 - Translate the summary from Step 1 into Spanish, with a prefix that says "Translation: ".
					USER
						"""insert text here"""

- Provide example:
	-you intend for the model to copy a particular style of responding to user queries which is difficult to describe explicitly. This is known as "few-shot" prompting.
	- 
	
=Tactic: Specify the desired length of the output
	- USER
Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in about 50 words.
OR
Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in 3 bullet points.


- Strategy: Provide reference text
	- SYSTEM
			Use the provided articles delimited by triple quotes to answer questions. If the answer cannot be found in the articles, write "I could not find an answer."
	USER
		<insert articles, each delimited by triple quotes>

		Question: <insert question here>
		
: Instruct the model to answer with citations from a reference text
	-SYSTEM
		You will be provided with a document delimited by triple quotes and a question. Your task is to answer the question using only the provided document and to cite the passage(s) of the document used to answer the question. If the document does not contain the information needed to answer this question then simply write: "Insufficient information." If an answer to the question is provided, it must be annotated with a citation. Use the following format for to cite relevant passages ({"citation": â€¦}).
	USER
		"""<insert document here>"""

Question: <insert question here>

"""insert text here"""

Use external tools
	-Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval
	- Use code execution to perform more accurate calculations or call external APIs
	- EG: SYSTEM
		You can write and execute Python code by enclosing it in triple backticks, e.g. ```code goes here```. Use this to perform calculations.
		USER
			Find all real-valued roots of the following polynomial: 3*x**5 - 5*x**4 - 3*x**3 - 7*x - 10.
    -  Give the model access to specific functions
			e.g. convert "Who are my top customers?" to get_customers(min_revenue: int, created_before: string, limit: int) and call your internal API
			
==========================================================================================================


CODEX

 -  Codex can use this data to help you write accurate query requests. 
   eg:# Table albums, columns = [AlbumId, Title, ArtistId]
		# Table artists, columns = [ArtistId, Name]
		-USER:Create a query for all albums by Adele
- Converting between languages. 
	- Python to R
		ou can get Codex to convert from one language to another by following a simple format where you list the language of the code you want to convert in a comment, followed by the code and then a comment with the language you want it translated into
	- EG:
		# Convert this from Python to R
			# Python version

			[ Python code ]

			# End

			# R version
 - Checking code for errors.
 - Writing unit tests. 
 - Explaining an SQL query
 - Creating example data. 	
	- you can ask Codex to create data like arrays of made up names, products and other variables.
	- /* Create an array of weather temperatures for San Francisco */
	- var weather = [
		{ month: 'January', high: 58, low: 48 },
		{ month: 'February', high: 61, low: 50 }]

	- valuable insights that can help you make better business decisions,
	- its ability to tailor the content of conversational AI.
	- This grounding data also helps the model avoid generating responses based on your new data
	- OpenAI's powerful GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 l
	- a REST API or the web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio
	- Azure OpenAI on your data, together with Azure Cognitive Search, determines what data to retrieve from the designated data source based on the user input and provided conversation history
	- Azure OpenAI on your data uses an Azure Cognitive Search index to determine what data to retrieve based on user inputs and provided conversation history. 
	- The model provides the best citation titles from markdown (.md) files
	- If a document is a PDF file, the text contents are extracted as a preprocessing step (unless you're connecting your own Azure Cognitive Search index
	- Ingestion of data:
		Blobs in an Azure storage container that you provide
		Local files uploaded using the Azure OpenAI Studio
		URLs/web addresses.
		
	how data get processed after ingestion from AZURE container:
		

	1-Ingestion assets are created in Azure Cognitive Search resource and Azure storage account. Currently these assets are: indexers, indexes, data sources, a custom skill in the search resource, and a container (later called the chunks container) in the Azure storage account. You can specify the input Azure storage container using the Azure OpenAI studio, or the ingestion API.

	2- Data is read from the input container, contents are opened and chunked into small chunks with a maximum of 1024 tokens each. If vector search is enabled, the service will calculate the vector representing the embeddings on each chunk. The output of this step (called the "preprocessed" or "chunked" data) is stored in the chunks container created in the previous step.

	3- The preprocessed data is loaded from the chunks container, and indexed in the Azure Cognitive Search index.
	
	if data is fomr url: crawling component first crawl the url ans store the content is azur estorage.
