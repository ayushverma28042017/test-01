1-Scenario based Aws questions asked to me Scenario: You are managing a high-traffic web application hosted on AWS. Recently, you've noticed intermittent performance issues during peak hours, resulting in increased latency and occasional downtime. How would you diagnose and address this issue?
>Use CloudWatch metrics to monitor CPU, Memory usage and set auto scaling.

>>
• Start by analyzing CloudWatch metrics for EC2 instances, RDS databases, and any other relevant services during peak hours.
• Use AWS X-Ray or CloudWatch logs to identify bottlenecks in application code.
• Consider horizontal scaling with Auto Scaling groups to handle increased traffic.
• Utilize AWS CloudFront for caching static content and reducing latency.
• Implement AWS Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic evenly.

2 Scenario: Your company is planning to migrate its on-premises data center to AWS. As part of the migration strategy, you need to ensure minimal downtime and data loss. How would you plan and execute the migration process?
>Assessment is key when planning for migration. Using canary or blue-green deployment models.

>>
• Conduct a thorough assessment of current infrastructure and dependencies.
• Utilize AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for seamless database migration.
• Employ AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) for migrating virtual machines.
• Implement a phased migration approach to minimize downtime, possibly using AWS Direct Connect for high-speed data transfer.
• Test thoroughly in a staging environment before executing the final migration.



3- Scenario: You are responsible for securing an AWS infrastructure hosting sensitive customer data. How would you design and implement a robust security strategy to protect against data breaches and unauthorized access?
>Security is essential when moving to cloud. Applying zero-trust policies and using services like AWS IAM, Guard duty, WAF, AWS Shield, segmenting resources in a protected layers can protect the data and resources.

4- Scenario: Your application relies heavily on AWS Lambda functions for processing incoming requests. Recently, you've observed a significant increase in execution times and occasional timeouts. How would you optimize the performance of Lambda functions to mitigate these issues?
>Add queue and increase concurrency limits. If the logic executes beyond 15 minutes, then it needs to be moved from Lambda to another service such as EC2, ECS.

5- Scenario: Your organization is experiencing exponential growth in data volume, leading to increased storage costs on AWS. How would you design a cost-effective storage solution that balances performance, scalability, and cost efficiency?
>Apply life cycle policies to move data between different storage classes.

6- Scenario: You are tasked with designing a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture for a critical application on AWS. How would you leverage AWS services such as Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Multi-AZ deployments to achieve high availability and resilience?
> Apply rules to monitor metrics like CPU, Memory to decide when to scale-out/in, schedule scaling, deploy resources attest in two different AZ's, use health probe to monitor and re-route traffic to health instance and replace new resources for the failed ones.

7- Scenario: Your development team is adopting a microservices architecture for a new project on AWS. How would you design a scalable and resilient infrastructure to support microservices deployment, communication, and monitoring?
>Using Eventbridge, ECS or Fargate to effectively implement a Micro-service architecture.

8- Scenario: Your company operates globally and needs to ensure low-latency access to its web application for users in different geographic regions. How would you architect a distributed application infrastructure using AWS services like Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, and AWS Global Accelerator to optimize performance and reduce latency?
>Use CloudFront for static files, latency based routing with Route 53 and deploy global accelerator in front of load balancers.

9- Scenario: You are tasked with implementing disaster recovery (DR) capabilities for critical applications hosted on AWS. How would you design and configure a DR solution that provides rapid recovery, data integrity, and minimal downtime in the event of a disaster?

>Use Elastic disaster recovery service.

10- Scenario: Your organization is planning to deploy a containerized application on AWS using Amazon ECS. How would you design the architecture and infrastructure to orchestrate and manage containers effectively, ensuring scalability, availability, and performance?
Use EKS.



-----------------------------WAF stands for Web Application Firewall----------------------------
-security layer that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect their availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. 
	1- Filtering and Monitoring:
		-filters the HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet,
		-allow or block based on predefined rules
		-monitor and inspect :inspect both the request and the payload.
	2-Rule-based Security Policies: 
		-custom security rules to block specific types of traffic or requests
		-as SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), or known malicious bots
		-rule can be on IP addresses, HTTP headers, request methods, or content.
	3-Managed Rule Sets: 
	4-Integration with Other AWS Services:
		-tegrates with other AWS services such as AWS CloudFront (Content Delivery Network), Amazon API Gateway, and Application Load Balancer. 
		-llows you to deploy WAF protection at the edge of your AWS infrastructure, closer to your users, for faster response times and improved performance
	5.Loggin and Monitoring:
		-logs and metrics that allow you to monitor the traffic patterns and security events affecting your web applications. 
	6.Scalability and High Availability
		-WAF is designed to scale automatically to handle large volumes of traffic and maintain high availability for your web applications
	7.Cost-effective Security: 
		-you pay only for the resources you use, such as the number of web requests inspected or the rules processed

OLTP and OLAP data modeling and querying are fundamentally different!

OLTP:
- focused on latest state of data
- normalization and 3rd normal form are powerful
- optimized for point queries or single user queries
- query latency matters a lot
- using CTEs can sometimes produce extra latency that you don’t want

OLAP:
- care about latest state and historical data
- normalization can cause some queries to be painfully slow
- optimized for GROUP BY statements across a large number of records
- query latency matters a little
- use CTEs instead of subqueries every single time
