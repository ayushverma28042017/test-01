In episode six of the podcast, we talk to Parin Mehta, former Managing Director for APAC at Airbnb and current Venture Partner at Menyala, about the intimidating topic of career transitions.


Changing careers can be daunting, especially if you have invested a significant amount of time and effort in your current one. That process requires us to leave our comfort zone.


We use the Learning Zone Model to illustrate the various "zones" outside our "comfort zone": the "fear" zone, "learning" zone, and lastly, the "growth" zone.


Parin uses his own career change journey from Airbnb to Menyala as an example of how he left his comfort zone, braved through the fear zone, embraced the learning zone and moved to the growth zone; breaking through each zone in order to reach the next level.
