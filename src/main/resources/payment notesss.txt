

 Currently we are considering only payments side ,Collection will start soon (in phase 2)
 Paynow (online) is the preferred mode for payments of <200k. Giro will be the secondary payment method and outsourced cheque as the last option (BCP).
 For Payment we are thinking to have payment method at client level instead of policy/transacion level. By doing this it will reduce complexity adn ease customer service..
 As we know PAunow(FAST real time) has limit of $200k per transaction where as Paynow(GIRO) has no limit but follow T+2(DBS/POSB) or T+3(non-DBS)
 if we are using Payment on GIRO , a copy of bank statement need to obtained to check if correct person to receive the payout is account holder.
 - Work with finance to get the stats on customer that are registered using NRIC for PAynow or and run campaign for those who have yet to .
 -COST:
    Paynow FAST $0.20 per transaction
	Paynow GIRO : $0.05 per transaction

General Inter-bank Recurring Order (GIRO) is an automated electronic payment service which allows you to make monthly payment to the billing organisation (BO) from your bank account directly

GIRO set up can be done via 2 methods: 

iDDA which is an approval of a GIRO application via API and occurs instantaneously. 

Hard copy application form which SGL would send off to DBS. FNZ would then retrieve the result form via FTP (3-6 weeks)

Varun ::
1- Platform solution
2- Integration with PAS
3-Cannot use Singlife as piggyback but surely we cna re-use the asset

FAST: indiviudal debit, 5 transaction , 2 reject,, ack3:3 succes, so 3 debt in acc.. but in bank stattement only 3 T.
- proxy is active, and payer acc is clsoed when transaciotn initiated  .. so in bank statement there will be debit and credit.
- statement can be chekc on netbanking
- CAS lookup fail.. no debit from acc, no statement in transaction
- If status is Pending, will get updated status in 15 min,, after that status shud be there.. if still pending send mail to dbs tech team
-  After 11:59, statment day will be tmrw day but value day will same day.
- transaction statement will be only till 11:30 pm after that it will move to next day transaction.
-    00:00 - for FAST,
-    uat pending mock is not .it will always give pending--it will send dub-pedning

	  resilient microservice
		-withstand failures and continue to function.
		- common ways to make resilient is	:
			- using circuit breaker
				- llows a microservice to stop calling another microservice if the other microservice is unavailable
				- This prevents the first microservice from getting stuck in an infinite loop of retries.
			- using retyr
			- using health check
			-desing ms lossly couple
			- use msg to comm withing ms
			- use LB to disctirbute traffic
			-deploy in cloud
