Common attack
methods include SQL injection attacks,
 man-in-the-middle attacks, 
 denial-of-service attacks, 
 credential stuffing attacks
and
 access control exploits.

As the API was not
protected by any form of authentication, the attacker was able to make an API request for customer details. The
incident further demonstrates the need to adhere to API best practices that would have mitigated the extent of the
breach, such as implementing techniques to obfuscate customer details, and rate limiting to prevent mass data
exfiltration within a short timeframe.


Document API usage, technical requirements, and integration processes, ensuring all relevant information is
regularly updated in accordance to change management policies.
• Encrypt all API traffic using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacks.
Implement proper access control to APIs and API users should use proven authentication and authorisation
mechanism to control, where needed.
• Implement rate limiting and limit payload sizes based on established rules to defend again denial-of-service
attacks or brute force attacks.
• Monitor and log API activities to detect any anomalous behaviour in API traffic and facilitate the
implementation of appropriate mitigation measures.

SSL.com's TLS certificates safeguards your website from MITM attacks by encrypting all data with a secret key that is only known to the original client and server. MITM attackers are not able to read or tamper with the encrypted data without knowledge of this secret key.
